# What is this book? 
This book is a book on C#. It won't assume you have any programming experience, however it does not teach you how to install the tooling. In order to follow along I reccomend you download the .Net core SDK and runtime, and an editor of your choice. I use visual studio code, but normal Visual Studio may be easier to follow along on. I won't be teaching how to use an editor, however assuming you got it installed and setup, it should be fairly simple to follow along.


This book will contain information up until classes and inheritence. In the future I may expand it to talk about asynchronous programming and threading - however that is not the primary focus of this book. Other then that, once you got .Net core and the editor of your choice installed, let's get started.

When you make a new project, the default file should look something like 
```CSharp
namespace (ProjectName){
    class Program{
        static void Main(string[] args){

        }
    }
}
```
If that's set, move on to the next page.
